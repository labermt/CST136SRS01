Side info:
Decided to chose in class initializers 
http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c48-prefer-in-class-initializers-to-member-initializers-in-constructors-for-constant-initializers
rangeint is a class because of the link above
For this assignment, I worked as a group with classmates, their names were:
Colin, Drew, Sasha, Thea, and Mike.

Purpose:

- Pratice using various C++ error handling mechanisms.
- Learn to use C++ exceptions.
- Understand the exception class hierarchy and how to extend it. 
- Learn about ctor options. 

Create an integer range class or struct named "RangeInt".  

Create a ctor that accepts: \[lower bound, upper bound).  
Create a default ctor is unbound on both upper and lower values.  

Create the default ctor by delegating, default parameters, or default generation.  

Create a const member for kUnboundLower and kUnboundUpper.  

Create lower bound and upper bound setters and getters. Handle narrowing conversions (float, double, long, unsigned, ...). Allow std::string and c-strings for setters and handle non-valid strings.  

Create setters for the value and throw an exception if the value exceeds the bounds. Ensure a strong exception guarantee.  

Create a getter for the value.  

Devise a strategy for dealing with changing bounds when the value is outside the bounds.  

Write test code in main the exercises your code. Be sure to use a try/catch block and std::exception::what() in your testing code.  

Don't forget to use noexcept and const when and where applicable.  

Describe the reason(s) for your default ctor technique in the README.md.  

Describe the reason you made RangeInt a struct or class. (see the cppguidelines for details.)
